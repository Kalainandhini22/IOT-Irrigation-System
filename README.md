# IOT-Irrigation-System
This project is a low-cost, IoT-enabled system for monitoring environmental conditions to support small-scale farming. It uses a NodeMCU (ESP8266) to read real-time temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor. The data is then transmitted to the Blynk cloud platform, allowing for remote monitoring via a smartphone.
